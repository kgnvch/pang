Bonus tasks implemented:
------------------------

* Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty +++
There are 3 levels, each level adding an extra ball at the start with a short delay from the previous ball.
There is an individual script for each level handling this behaviour and each set of balls for every level is stored as a separate scene.
I impleneted it because I think it easily incorporates with what Unity allows to do (individual level scripts, individual scenes, LoadSceneAsync additively).

* Custom visuals and shaders ++
I used 3D cameras, charater animations, 3D objects in UI and particle systems. It all adds a nice feel and involves various aspects of Unity.

* Custom soundtracks and SFX +
Adding sounds is quite easy so I did it.
